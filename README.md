## API Keys & Secrets

Sensitive credentials (such as Webhook URL, bot token, spreadsheet ID, and service account JSON) are **not** included in the repository. They are managed via environment variables:

```env
WEBHOOK_URL="..."
BOT_TOKEN="..."
TARGET_ROLE_NAME="..."
SPREADSHEET_ID="..."
SHEET_NAME="..."
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON="..."  # Entire content of service_account.json 
```
‚ö†Ô∏è GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON is stored as a string in the .env file, and dynamically written to a temp file at runtime.
